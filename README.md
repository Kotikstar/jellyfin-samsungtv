# SamsungSmartTV

Warning: This app is a legacy program meant for older Samsung Smart TVs running Orsay (pre-2015), which has since been replaced by Tizen. It may be possible to use this app by side-loading, but it is considered unsupported (we are unable to help you with it).

You may also wish to try a web browser with Jellyfin, wherever possible.

This is a fork of the original jellyfin-samsungtv repo which is now archived. If you own an older samsung TV as I do you probably wanted a more updated app. Feel free to use and start issues and pull requests. However, I am not the original developer of this app so I maynot be able to provide the best help.
